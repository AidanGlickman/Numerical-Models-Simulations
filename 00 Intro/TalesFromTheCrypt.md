# Homework 1: Tales from the Crypt

> Identify the parts of the modeling process in the scientific paper [Tales from the Crypt](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5968506_Examples_of_Mathematical_Modeling_Tales_from_the_Crypt)

## Reminder of the process:
1. Ask a question
2. Identify factors that affect the question
3. Simplify with assumptions
4. Write equations/create graphs
5. Analyze the model 
	* Compare to what data exists 
	* Look at extreme values
6. Try to answer your question
7. Go back, consider you assumptions with the goal of making your model better

## Homework
1. Questions: 
	1. How do we describe both homeostasis and unregulated growth in tumorigenesis?
2. Factors:
	1. Stability of population
	2. Cell Divisions
	3. Growth Rate
	4. Feedback
3. Assumptions
	1. Does not take into account where the individual cells are in the cell cycle. All cells start at the same place in the cycle
	2. Assuming all division are symmetric
	3. Selective advantage gained by a mutation will instantly conferred to the whole population
	4. Stem cells and transit-amplifying cells are assumed to divide on different time scales
4. All the equations are images so I can't be asked
5. >We have shown how by incorporating the more stringent linear feedback into the stem cells, but not the transit cell compartment, it is then only the transit cells that can become the cancer stem cells. **This may well be the best reflection of the actual situation** in the large colorectal crypt.

6. Each model has different values
