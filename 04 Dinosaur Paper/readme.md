# Dino Model Notes

## Modeling Types
MECHANISTIC | EMPIRICAL
---- | ----
1. He discusses several mechanistic models, in which researchers looked at physical features to try to determine the lifestyles of different dinosaurs | 1. The digital spinosaurus model used in this study is empirical, as it depends on available data instead of trying to make connections to other dinosaurs or anything like that
1. The digital model is mechanistic, as it uses samples from other large dinosaurs to fill in gaps they didn't have bones for | 1. With the assumption that all dinosaur air sacs are of similar construction, finding the size of air sacs was done empirically, looking at different dinosaurs to find different size samples was done empirically
1. Cavity measurements in the dinosaurs were based off of a symbolic link to modern reptiles | 1.
