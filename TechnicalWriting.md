# Technical Writing Advice

## Tips 

* Only **very short** equations and expressions should be put in-line with text.
* Expressions and equations which are placed in-line with text should be simple, and grammatically they should be treated as their value.
* Comparison symbols (=, <, >) and operators (+, -, ×, ⁄) are **not** verbs
* Numbers included should respect the limits of precision derived from how those numbers were found
* The formatting of a number should be a way to convey the meaning or message the number is included for.
* Any number which is too large to be understood at a glance should be given the same formatting considerations as a long equation or expression.
* Do not start sentences with symbols, numerical symbols or any other mathy stuff.

## Progression from Badly Written to Correct

1. Because `X^2 <= 0`, `x = 0`.
1. Because `X^2 <= 0`, `x` must be `0`.
	* Operators are not verbs
1. Because `X^2 <= 0` is `true`, x must be `0`.
	* make clear evaluations
1. Because `X^2 <= 0` is `true` the value of x must be zero.
	* This is a paper, write out "zero" 

## Guidelines for Long Equations, Expressions, and Numbers

* On their own line
* *Italicized*
* Centered
* Still part of the grammar of the previous line
* If the entire equation is to be referenced, give it an ID.
* Step-by-Step derivation is unwelcome. Only exception is if there is a particular "trick" being used to rewrite the equation which should be showcased.
* All symbols should be defined, along with relevant units.
